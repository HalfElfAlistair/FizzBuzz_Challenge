## Introduction

My friend told me about this challenge and said it'd be a good one to assist with my JavaScript learning.

### Course Aim

The game works by people calling out numbers in order but replacing the number with the word 'Fizz' (when a multiple of 3), 'Buzz' when a multiple of 5 and 'FizzBuzz' when a multiple of both 3 and 5.

For example at 7 the program should call 7.

At 18 it should call 'Fizz'

At 20 it should call 'Buzz'.

At 15 it should call 'FizzBuzz'.

When actually playing the game you would continue until you had a winner but Looking at challenge briefs online they limited the program to run til 100.

### Personal Aims

Build on my learning in a practical setting.

Complete a challenge without a 'hint' or 'solution' option, as those I've encountered on freeCodeCamp did and sometimes I've still had to look there for assistance.

I've found myself using multiple learning resources for JavaScript and this has been a very useful one.

### [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/)
This has been a good tool for testing code and getting an idea of the processes involved so it's easier to know what I have to change.

## Author Notes

I was successful in both of my aims. Completing this without having to look at hints or anything was really important for my confidence as it showed I am progressing and can get the hang of this.

Admittedly, this challenge took me about an hour to do which is a long time. Definitely something that will get better as I go along though so I'm not too worried. I've read it's something that gets set in interviews sometimes so it's important I can reach a stage where producing code like this only takes me a few minutes.

At present it's pretty basic, just using an alert system. Once I've learned more I'll look into making it more user friendly and visually appealing.
